hello everyone welcome to my channel today i'm going to show you 
how you can connect windows forms application to Oracle Database 
using secure way 
this is my first video on youtube soon i'll getting a microphone so i can add
commentary in the video 

okay for connecting oracle to c# application 
we need to add Oracle Client Library into our project 
lets get started since i've already installed it i can it through 
now the library is added now i'll create a connection string in app.config file

Data Source=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME=orcl1)));User Id=scott;Password=tiger;
this is the connection string use to connect with oracle before adding this you need to check
your
HOST:PORT:SERVICE_NAME:
and your database username and password
now im going to add this in my connectionnstring attribure

i've already created a form with a button 

as you saw we've connected to the oracle database
